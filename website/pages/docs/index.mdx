# Introduction

Landing blocks is a react component library that packs together all the fundamental landing page components you need.
These components are built to be self contained and super reusable in all your projects.
Every component is built with these principles in mind:

-   no global css needed: all components are styled using emotion
-   completely customizable: you can create a lot of design variations, just look at the demos
-   good defaults: the components look nice with little effort
-   easily extendible: you can easily pass your own components to the blocks props
-   themeable: every components uses the theme colors

The available components follow the landing pages most common elements, you can explore them in the main page

## How to use Landing Blocks

First install it with its peer dependencies

```bash
npm install landing-blocks @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming @chakra-ui/core
# or
yarn add landing-blocks @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming @chakra-ui/core
```

You have to use the components under a `LandingProvider`, this component passes the customization and base theme to other landing blocks components

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Head from 'next/head'
import { Hero, NavBar, EmailForm } from 'landing-blocks/src'
const Page = () => (
    <LandingProvider primary='#2D7FF9'>
        <NavBar
            logo={<img width='120px' src='/logo.svg' />}
            navs={[
                <a>Features</a>,
                <a>Use Cases</a>,
                <a>Pricing</a>,
                <a>About Us</a>,
                <a>Login</a>,
            ]}
        />
        <Hero
            heading='Create, your way'
            subheading='Super cool subheading'
            image={<img width='500px' src='/hero.png' />}
            cta={<EmailForm />}
            fingerprint='Already using xxx? Sign in'
        />
    </LandingProvider>
)
```

## LandingProvider

LandingProvider supports other props that let you customize the global look of your page

Here is an example of customization you can do

```jsx
<LandingProvider
    dark // make all text white, enable dark mode in all components
    background='#000'
    primary='#2D7FF9' // the primary color used in buttons, decoration elements, ...
    black='#222' // the body text color
    white='#ffe' // the body text color when in dark mode
    fontFamily='Roboto'
    pageWidth='1000px'
>
    <NavBar navs={[]} />
</LandingProvider>
```

## The Dark prop

The dark prop changes the color of all the text element form `black` to `white` and sets the chakra-ui ColorMode to `dark`

You can use this prop when your background is dark and you need to invert the text and other components color

Every Landing Block has the same dark prop that does the same thing

```jsx
<LandingProvider dark>
    <NavBar
        bg='black'
        dark // inverts text color
    />
    <Hero
        bg='blue'
        dark
    />
</LandingProvider>
```
